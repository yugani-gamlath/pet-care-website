						<p> There is a difference between experiencing pain as a human versus experiencing pain as an animal: from an evolutionary standpoint, prior to the modern age of demestication, the early ancestors of our companion animals knew that showing pain would mean being killed and eaten by predators or being ostracized from their packs. Thus, the signs of ppain in animals are very subtle, requiring trained eyes and hands to recognize and treat it.
